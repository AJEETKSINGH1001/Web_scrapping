"In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as themahajanapadas.[92][93]The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions.Jainismcame into prominence during the life of its exemplar,Mahavira.[94]Buddhism, based on the teachings ofGautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[95][96][97]In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held uprenunciationas an ideal,[98]and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom ofMagadhahad annexed or reduced other states to emerge as theMauryan Empire.[99]The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101]The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as forAshoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhistdhamma.[102][103]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png,/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal

"By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including theEnglish East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[134][135]The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over theBengalregion by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138]Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[139]India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying theBritish Empirewith raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[134]By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture.[140]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Gopuram_Corner_View_of_Thanjavur_Brihadeeswara_Temple..JPG/164px-Gopuram_Corner_View_of_Thanjavur_Brihadeeswara_Temple..JPG,/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=India

Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction inEurope.[141][142][143][144]However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off theIndian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[145][146]Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and thedirect administration of Indiaby the British government. Proclaiming aunitary stateand a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[147][148]In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of theIndian National Congressin 1885.[149][150][151][152]",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/India_1835_2_Mohurs.jpg/284px-India_1835_2_Mohurs.jpg,/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=India
